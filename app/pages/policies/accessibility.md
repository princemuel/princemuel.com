This site is made for people.

Accessibility, diversity and inclusion are important values that affect everything we do.
Whether you use a screen-reader, voice recognition software or another kind of assistive technology,
I'm doing my best to make it easy for users to navigate this site and find exactly what they need.

## Accomplishing Accessibility Goals

I've set my web accessibility standards high and work hard to achieve them. As such,
I'm dedicated to ensuring this site meets all current laws and guidelines -
including the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)][wcag-link]
and I try to be AA compliant as much as possible.

In doing so, I hope to make the web more inclusive and accessible, creating a useable
experience for all visitors.

That being said, I'm not perfect and I'm always learning and improving the website.
I run automated testing for accessibility issues regularly, as well as
testing on desktop and mobile browsers with different zoom levels.

My main focus these days is Tailwind CSS — an open-source
utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

I made the decision to work on it full-time beginning in 2019,
and have a lot of plans for continuing to improve the framework,
grow the community, and expand the ecosystem.

Here are some of the other projects I've worked on in the past —
some still actively maintained, and others retired or on pause.

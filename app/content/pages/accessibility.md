This site is made for people.

Accessibility, diversity and inclusion are important values that affect everything
we do. Whether you use a screen-reader, voice recognition software or another kind
of assistive technology, I'm doing my best to make it easy for users to navigate
this site and find exactly what they need.

## Accomplishing Accessibility Goals

I've set my web accessibility standards high and work hard to achieve them. As such,
I'm dedicated to ensuring my site meets all current laws and guidelines -
including the
[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag)
and try to be AA compliant as much as possible.

In doing so, I hope to make the web more inclusive and accessible, creating a useable
experience for all visitors.

That being said, I'm not perfect and I'm always learning and improving the website.
I run automated testing for accessibility issues regularly, as well as
testing on desktop and mobile browsers with different zoom levels.

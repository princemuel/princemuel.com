  <!-- I want to setup my homepage to be a hub of (featured) posts,
  (featured) projects, a short bio with a link to my About page,  -->

I'm [@princemuel](https://x.com/iamprincemuel), a frontend developer
**(mostly)**, educator, musician, and relentless problem-solver.

I'm passionate about building great software, and I share everything I learn
along the wayâ€”whether through [articles](/blog), videos, courses, or talks.
I'm here to help developers create smarter, faster, and more maintainable code.

In 2024, I made the leap to working for myself, so I could focus on
building tools and resources that help others level up their skills.

These days, I'm focused on Current Project, and I document my journey
through regular updates in my [work journal](/journal).

Want to see what I'm working with? Check out my [wiki](/wiki) page
for a curated list of the software, hardware, and resources I rely on
to get things done.

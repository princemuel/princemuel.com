# Hi! I'm Samuel :wave:

I'm on a journey to become a frontend web developer. I love building little projects, trying out
new coding techniques, and sharing what I learn along the way. When I'm not at my desk, you'll
find me reading, playing my Ibanez guitar _Arabella_, hiking through the mountains, or
challenging myself on rock-climbing walls.

I started this blog to document my progress, keep myself accountable, and hopefully inspire
anyone else who's learning to code. Welcome to my corner of the internet, and thanks for
stopping by!
